there are several cases in which a migration is needed
- a new model is created, a migration creates the corresponding 
  database table. Migrations are also needed when a field is added 
  or removed from an existing model, or, when attributes of a field have changed.
  All of these changes to a model's file need a corresponding change to the database,
  and for these purposes migrations need to be created, and then run. 

COMMANDS
#Migrations
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py showmigrations
python3 manage.py migrate    #we can see all of the migrations were applied successfully
